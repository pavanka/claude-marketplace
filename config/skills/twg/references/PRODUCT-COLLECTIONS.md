## Common disambiguation

- **"Projects"** = Atlas projects (TWC), accessed via `twg projects`. These are cross-team initiative trackers with status updates, linked goals, and contributors.
- **"Spaces" in Jira** = Jira projects, accessed via `twg jira space`. These are issue containers with workflows, issue types, and boards.
- **"Spaces" in Confluence** = Confluence spaces, accessed via `twg confluence space`. These are content containers for pages and blogs.

Never confuse Atlas projects with Jira spaces — they serve different purposes in different collections.
